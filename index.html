        <h2 class = "home-description">My name is Matthew Canabarro, and I am an undergraduate student at Cornell University. I attend the College of Human Ecology, concentrating in Design and Environmental Analysis and minoring in Psychology and Architecture. I am passionate about exploring the implications of design on human experience in the spheres of architecture as well as digital user interface. I believe in the intrinsic connection between design and positive well-being, as well as the power that designers have to make the world a more comfortable place. Therefore, I am taking a multi-disciplinary approach to learning and to diversify my skill set – architecturally, psychologically, as well as digitally – in order to combine and apply these different areas of knowledge to the multitude of present and future contexts in our ever-changing world.</h2>
